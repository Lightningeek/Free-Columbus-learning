<p>If Columbus had not found America, innovation would be set back a couple centuries. This is because if Columbus had not found America the British or French or some other great power would have conquered America but this would have hindered the development of what makes us. This is because they would have found America a long time after Columbus, since few people had the idea to sail across the Atlantic to try to find ASIA. This could be a good thing or a bad one. This also means that there would be years separation before the world actually knew what the world looked like. Scientific research would have not been as fast without the new resources found on the North American continent. </p>

<p>As you can see, serious British colonization did not start until almost a century later!</p>
