<p>Columbus wanted to come to Asia because he believed that it would allow him to usher in an age of modern life and raise the standard of living.  The shorter routes to Asia could bring more silks spices and medicines than ever before. This is easier through ships because they can bring back more stuff through cheaper trade. He first asked the king of Portugal for funds for this trip. This would include ships and the cost of hiring men. He was turned down and thus went to the Spanish monarch who reluctantly agreed to his terms in exchange for much of the profit he would get by bringing back gold.
