<p>Columbus was born on 1451, probably in Genoa, Italy. His real name is Cristoforo Columbo, which was Anglicized to Christopher Columbus. He had no schooling. Before the big expedition, he had sailed on small business for his father. He had proved when sailing to be an incredible navigator, and thus begain dreaming of exploring the seas and perheps discover new trade routes. </p>

<p>The wealth from Asia was trickling into Europe for more than 200 years, and Europe was eager for more of it. Asian goods were scarce and expensive because they had to come by a dangerous overland route. Ships could carry them more cheaply and in greater quantity. Thatâ€™s why people were looking for an eastern sea route around Africa, or a western sea route across the Atlantic Ocean and beyond. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way of a new "system" called colonialization. The Portuguese sailed around the Cape of Good Hope (as we know it today) and smashed their way into Southeastern Asia and the South China Sea, and thus established one of the first overseas safer trade routes and many colonies. However, this also led to a flaw within this system called "colonialization" which went unnoticed by mercenaries and explorers alike. This flawed is named exploitation as we know it today. Young Christoforo Columbo, as we will see, is not an exception. </p>
