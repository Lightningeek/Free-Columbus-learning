His written records also lead to centuries of exploitation, suffering and prejudice against Natives from the New World. It also led to people blindly revering him for discovering America without digging deeper into his life and actions. Nowadays, his life, actions, and achievements can teach us a lot about how the world moved into a new era of colonialization.</p>

<p>Because of Columbus we had an era of imperialization and innovation. His papers and noted proved that the world was bigger than we thought and that other continents inhabited with people for hundreds of years. This triggered centuries of slavery, imports of new products and communication around the world. Slavery was certainly not good but this created the one of the first global, semi-friendly communication. His written record lead to suffering and prejudice against the native Americans and this suffering did not end. It led to people blindly supporting him and revering him as well as thinking him as a hero instead of an exploiter without digging deeper into his life and experiences. Nowadays his life and experiences can teach us a lot about how America moved into an era of imperialization.</p>
